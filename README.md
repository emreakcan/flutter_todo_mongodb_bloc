# Fluttur TODO app using MongoDB + Dart as backend.



## UI : 
BLoC pattern used for the UI, as it is suitable for most of the apps, makes testing easier and handling states is more managable.

## Backend : 
Dart and MongoDB used for Backend, Mongo's non-relational document model is easy to use for simple TODO app. There can be many other choices but that was the quickest way I could see. Simple tests written for Backend more to come if I can find some time.

Shelf package used for structing the backend, it handles most of the boilerplate part of writing a web server. Can mix and match synchronous and asynchronous processing, and it is very flexible.
